This system is being built in order to efficiently use open source software. Open source software come with specific licenses and knowing the terms of licenses allows an adequate use and its known vulnerabilities. The system is designed to accept any software packages and scan them for in order to follow an acceptable use policy. Open software are commonly used but they are governed by licenses that user must know in order to conform to the regulations. Not conforming to regulations can lead to severe drawbacks for companies or their vulnerability.

For the system to work, developers submit software packages to be scanned foe license and vulnerabilities, and then the results are stored on a datastore. Managers can review the results of the scan and write some policies for the use of the open source software. Once the policy documents are establishes, Developers can review them and managers can modify them if needed. The policy is also store in a datastore and can be accessed by the developer or manager.
 
It’s important for the system to be built because even though open software is free to use for anyone, its use is governed by ethical rules that make up its licenses. Allthesame, they are usually some vulnerability that is associated to it and could affect users.
