# ISQA3420PNikiema

This repository was created by Patrick Nikiema as part of my school project at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. The class is called Managing in a Digital World (ISQA3420-850). 

Though out this course, I will be creating issues to work on school-assigned activities. Each issue will move to a closed status as the semester goes on and milestones are completed. I will share links to my work with the instructor who will provide feedback. 
I will also have some diagrams to upload in order to be reviewed by the instructor.

The deliverables for the first assignment are:
- Executive Summary
- Data Flow Diagram
- Data Flow Diagram Dictionary
- Three Use Cases
- Overall GitHub Repository Design and Use

Besides having the above deliverables, my GitHub repository must have at leaset40 commits and 20 closed issues. 

Things are going well so far.
